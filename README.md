## Setup Instructions

### Step 1 ‚Äì Install Required Software
Make sure all the software listed above is installed.

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Configure Audio Devices
1. Open your **Advanced Sound Settings**.  
2. For both **Cable In 16ch** and **Cable Output**, which can be found inside **Playback** and **Recording**:
   - Channels: 16  
   - Bit depth: 16-bit or 24-bit  
   - Sample rate: 48000 Hz  
3. These settings are found in the **Advanced** tab of each audio device.

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì Configure Dolby Reference Player
1. Open **Dolby Reference Player**.  
2. Navigate to **Output Configuration**:
   - Set your **speaker layout** to your preferred setup.  
   - Set the **audio output device** to **CABLE In 16ch**.  

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì Assign Speaker Channels
1. Click the **three dots** next to "Output Configuration" to open the **Speaker Configuration** options.  
2. Assign numbers to each speaker output (e.g., L = 1, R = 2, etc.).  
3. Save and close the speaker configuration.

### Step 5 ‚Äì Configure VB-Audio Matrix Coconut
1. Open **VB-Audio Matrix Coconut**.  
2. In **Windows Devices** (WIN32.IN), use **CTRL + Left Click** to select **CABLE Output** as the input device.  

---

### Step 6 ‚Äì Add Your Amplifiers
1. Add your amplifier outputs inside **WIN1.OUT**, **WIN2.OUT**, **WIN3.OUT**, etc.  
2. Use **CTRL + Left Click** to assign each audio device.

---

### Step 7 ‚Äì Open the Routing Grid
1. Press **CTRL + 4** to open the **routing grid**.  
2. This grid allows you to map the Cable Output channels to your amplifier outputs.

---

### Step 8 ‚Äì Route Channels Correctly
1. You need to assign each channel from **Cable Output** (left side) to the correct **WINx.OUT channels**.  
2. Typical channel order:
   - L = 1  
   - R = 2  
   - Center = 3  
   - LFE = 4  
   - Remaining channels: route manually based on your setup.
3. To route a channel, simply press **CTRL + Click** on one of the black squares in the routing grid.  
4. Tip: Play a Dolby Atmos track in Dolby Reference Player, **mute all channels except the one you want to route**, then check the routing grid to see which channel is active. Repeat until all channels are correctly assigned.

---

### Step 9 ‚Äì Play Dolby Atmos Content
Once routing is complete:
1. Add a **Dolby Atmos track** to Dolby Reference Player.  
2. Press **Play**.  
3. Your setup should now output Dolby Atmos correctly through your non-certified amplifier.
